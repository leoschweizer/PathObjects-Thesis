\chapter{Introduction}
\label{c:introduction}

Program comprehension is an essential requirement during software development.
But although the tools developers use have evolved notably, it still remains a tedious task.
Consequently, it is reported that developers spend up to 60\% of the software engineering effort on building a satisfactory understanding of the system at hand \cite{corbi_program_1989, basili_evolving_1997, cornelissen_execution_2008}.
During this process, a mental model is constructed that maps the features of a software system to their source code representation \cite{latoza_maintaining_2006}.
