\subsection{Basic Concept}
\subsection{Diagram Aesthetics}
The object communication diagrams of \textsc{PathObjects} form a graph structure, whereby the objects constitute vertices, and the arrows representing messages constitute edges.
Graph drawing is a research area with a long history of its own, and the aesthetic properties that should be aimed at in order to maximize perceivability are well known.

\paragraph{Crossing Minimization} User studies suggest that the most important aesthetic criterion is the minimization of edge crossings \cite{purchase_effective_2000, purchase_graph_2004, purchase_graph_2010}.

\paragraph{Area Minimization}

\paragraph{Symmetry}

\paragraph{Clustering}

\paragraph{Orthogonality}

\subsection{Automatic Diagram Layout}
In general, there are many profound arguments for generating diagram layouts automatically.
For instance, automated drawing of diagrams has the side-effect that conformance to a certain style guide .
Furthermore, the costs of communication and thus the total costs of production and maintenance can be reduced by use of automated drawing of diagrams.
But the strongest reason to rely on the automated generation of diagram layouts becomes evident when taking the intended use of \textsc{PathTools} into account.
