\subsection{Basic Concept}
\subsection{Diagram Aesthetics}
The object communication diagrams of \textsc{PathObjects} form graph structures, whereby  objects constitute nodes, and the arrows representing messages constitute edges.
Graph drawing is a research area with a long history of its own, and the aesthetic properties that should be aimed at in order to maximize perceivability are well known.
Consequently, it stands to reason that these criteria should also be applied to the diagrams created through our approach.

\paragraph{Crossing Minimization} User studies suggest that the most important aesthetic criterion is the minimization of edge crossings \cite{purchase_effective_2000, purchase_graph_2004, purchase_graph_2010}.
The more edges cross each other, the harder it becomes for the human eye to keep track of which nodes are connected by an edge.
Graph drawings that do not entail edge crossings are called planar, and are regarded as the best-case scenario.
But although planar graph drawing algorithms are comparatively simple, the excessive optimization of drawings in these premises will most likely interfere with other aesthetic criteria.

\paragraph{Bend Minimization} 

\paragraph{Area Minimization} The minimization of the area a diagram takes up is especially important when it cannot be scaled down arbitrarily.
This is the case with \textsc{PathObjects} diagrams, since textual information associated with nodes and edges has to stay above perceptive thresholds and may not overlap.
Furthermore, the efficient utilization of screen space is important.
Although the interactive information presentation offers scrolling functionality and thus allows diagram extents to exceed the viewport, scrolling interferes with reading the diagram and consequently complicates the assimilation of information.

\paragraph{Symmetry}

\paragraph{Clustering}

\paragraph{Orthogonality} Some authors state that fixing nodes and edges to an orthogonal grid improves the understandability of graph drawings \cite{sugiyama_methods_1981, batini_what_1985}.
And although Purchase et al. could not find significant evidence for this claim in a user study \cite{purchase_which_1997}, the majority of participants that were confronted with different variations of UML collaboration diagrams in another study nevertheless favored this edge routing strategy over other approaches \cite{purchase_graph_2004}.

\subsection{Automatic Diagram Layout}
In general, there are many profound arguments for generating diagram layouts automatically.
For instance, automated drawing of diagrams has the side-effect that conformance to a certain style guide .
Furthermore, the costs of communication and thus the total costs of production and maintenance can be reduced by use of automated drawing of diagrams.
But the strongest reason to rely on the automated generation of diagram layouts becomes evident when taking the intended use of \textsc{PathTools} into account.
