\chapter{PathObjects for Squeak/Smalltalk}
\label{c:implementation}
To validate the applicability of the \textsc{PathObjects} concept, we put it into practice in the form of a prototype for the Squeak/Smalltalk environment.
This chapter describes the implementation of this prototype, which also served as a basis for the performance analysis and user evaluation (cf. Chapter \ref{c:discussion}).
Section \ref{s:ImplementationPrototype} shows how the single concepts - namely navigation, exploration, focusing, and information layers - are realized.
The subsequent sections present technical implementation details.
Section \ref{s:ImplementationTracing} describes how the lightweight tracing approach works.
Furthermore, it explains the necessary extensions of the \textsc{PathTools} framework that allow us to reconstruct object interactions and referential relationships.
Finally, Section \ref{s:ImplementationLayouting} illustrates how \textsc{PathObjects} traces can be mapped to graphs, and how this circumstance is exploited to arrange objects and to route messages with the help of \textsc{Graphviz}.

\subsection{Navigation}
\label{ss:ImplementationNavigation}
The implementation of the \textsc{PathObjects} concept for Squeak/Smalltalk offers three features that assist developers in navigating through an execution history.
First, the timeline gives an overview of all steps of the execution, or respectively the message sends and returns.
Second, the mini-map displays which objects are currently in the viewport, and which other objects also occur during the execution.
Third, the search bar allows developers to find classes, message sends, or specific instances

	}
	\label{fig:ImplementationTimeline}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationTimeline} shows examples of the timeline view.
Each bar represents a step of the execution history, or respectively either a message send or the return from a message send.
The alignment along the horizontal axis corresponds to the chronological order of appearances.
The current step is marked with a blue overlay, and the corresponding send or return step is marked in red.
Developers can use the timeline to navigate through the execution history by either selection a specific step, by using the keyboard's left and right arrows, or by clicking the arrows that are displayed alongside the timeline.

All three examples in Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationTimeline} show the exact same execution history at the exact same point of the execution.
Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationTimelineDefault} represents the default configuration of the timeline view.
In this case, the height of the single timeline items corresponds to the depth of the call stack.
However, the concept of information layers (cf. \ref{??}\todo{cite}) allows to map arbitrary metrics to this dimension of the diagram.
Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationTimelineSearch} shows how search results are highlighted within the timeline.
In the depicted example, the developer performed a search for occurrences of the \inlinecode{attach:} message.
Two matches are found, whereby each consists of a send and a returns step.
These occurrences correspond to the registration of the analog and digital clock instances at the clock timer.
Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationTimelineMetrics} illustrates the usage of information layers in conjunction with the timeline view.
The height of the items now no longer represents the stack depth, but the number of variable accesses in each method.
The color of the items indicates the lines of code of each message.
One can see that the current step is the one with by far the most variable accesses.
Furthermore, the visualization indicates that most methods have an acceptable length, with the exception of the method that is the implementation of the selected message.

\subsubsection{Minimap}
Contrary to the timeline, which allows to explore the chronological dimension of execution traces, the mini-map supports developers in the navigation of the spatial dimension of object interaction diagrams.
It shows all objects that occur in a trace at a glance and allows to jump to any part of the canvas through mouse interactions.
Furthermore, it depicts which part of the canvas is currently displayed through a miniaturized viewport indicator.
Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationMinimapDefault} depicts the default mini-map visualization.
All objects that are involved in the current step, either as sender, receiver, or argument of a message, are marked in green.
Objects that already occurred in the past of the execution history are depicted as black boxes.
Objects that did not occur up to the current step but will occur in future steps are marked in light gray.
Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationMinimapMetric} represents an example how information layers can be applied to the mini-map.
In this case, the fan-in metric is mapped to the color of the object's representatives.
The heated-object scale indicates few received messages with light colors and the percipience of many messages in dark colors.
One can see that one object, namely the clock timer, receives more messages than any other object in this trace.

\section{Data Acquisition}
\label{s:ImplementationTracing}
This section describes how the data required for the reconstruction of object interactions is gathered.
The basic prerequisite is that objects can be distinguished and identified.
Since the Squeak image does not offer an adequate functionality, the strategy that was applied to solve this issue is depicted in Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingIdentification}.
Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingApproach} describes how the tracing approach works.
Finally, Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingReferences} shows how the tracking and mapping of outbound object pointers are implemented.

\subsection{Identification of Objects}
\label{ss:ImplementationTracingIdentification}
The fundamental requirement for the reconstruction of object interactions from traces is that object instances can be identified unambiguously.
Unfortunately, the Squeak image does not provide such a functionality out of the box.
Though objects do have an \inlinecode{identityHash} attribute, the value of this attribute is neither unique nor stable \cite{goldberg_smalltalk-80:_1983}.
In the virtual machine we used, it is derived from the least significant bits of the object pointer which is managed by the virtual machine and represents the object's address in main memory.
Hence, the value of the object pointer and thus the value of the \inlinecode{identityHash} are subject to change during garbage collection, which may cause objects to be moved in main memory.
Furthermore, since the \inlinecode{identityHash} uses only the 12 least significant bits, there is no guarantee that two objects that are not referentially equal cannot share a common hash value \cite{goldberg_smalltalk-80:_1983}.

The Squeak image does not offer a convenient way to access the object pointer, which could serve as unique identifier for objects.
There are workarounds that would allow to determine its value, but since this value still is subject to change during a tracing run due to the reasons pointed out above, it would require to disable garbage collection during this time span.
This could have undesired side effects, like excessive memory consumption or slow execution speeds due to increased memory allocation effort.

For these reasons, we chose a different approach that allows us to generate unique, stable identifiers for objects.
It exploits the fact that that a comparison for referential equality provided by the \inlinecode{==} method will always yield the correct result.
It returns true if the two objects have the same object pointer, and false otherwise.
Squeak provides a \inlinecode{WeakKeyIdentityDictionary} that has two beneficial properties for our use case.
First, it uses \inlinecode{==} comparison to test dictionary keys for equality.
That means that when using the objects that occur during tracing runs as keys, it is guaranteed that no two referentially distinct objects will be identified as the same key, and an object will always be mapped to the same key once it is present in the dictionary.
The second property is that it uses weak references to manage keys, which implicates that garbage collection of an object is not suspended by the fact that it is used as key in such a dictionary.

Consequently, this allows us to use objects occurring during tracing runs as keys, without interfering with the test execution.
Identifiers can be assigned to objects as values of the dictionary.
Thus, it is guaranteed that one object will always be mapped to the same identifier.
To ensure that no identifier is assigned to two referentially different objects, it is sufficient to use a continuously incrementing integer counter when assigning new identities, or respectively when adding new entries to the dictionary.

Since we presuppose that test cases are strictly deterministic (cf. Section \ref{s:DiscussionLimitations}), this strategy results in another benefit.
Namely, objects will always be assigned the same identifier in different tracing runs, since the identifier is only dependent on the chronological order in which objects occur in a trace.
In other words, to stick to the observer example, the instance of \inlinecode{DigitalClock} will always be assigned with the identifier \inlinecode{27} no matter how often the test is executed, since it is the 27th object that occurs in the trace.
This is an important property and prerequisite for the tracing and mapping of outbound object pointers (cf. Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingReferences}).

The current implementation constructs a new dictionary of identifiers for each test execution.
But it would also be possible to share identifiers of long living objects like classes across all tracing runs, if a global dictionary were used.
However, we are unaware of a use case that could exploit this possibility, and additional measures would be required to ensure the property described in the previous paragraph.
For these reasons, we favored trace-local over global identity generation.

\subsection{Tracing Approach}
\label{ss:ImplementationTracingApproach}
This section depicts the fundamental functional principles of the \textsc{PathTools} tracing framework that served as a basis of our prototypic implementation and describes the extensions that were required to adapt this framework to our requirements.

\subsubsection{Fundamental Functional Principles}

The fundamental idea behind the \textsc{PathTools} tracing approach is the distinction between shallow analysis and subsequent refinement runs.
During the shallow analysis phase, a trace of a selected test case is constructed that consists only of the bare minimum of information that is required for the reconstruction of the test execution.
This trace is presented to the developer who then can define which additional information is relevant for this specific scenario.
Refinements runs are performed to gather that additional information.
Thus, an extensive up-front collection of potentially useful information can be avoided. 

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../images/04-Tracing}
	\caption[TOC Caption]{Tracing foo}
	\label{fig:ImplementationTracing}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Shallow Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:ImplementationTracing} depicts the fundamental steps that are performed by the \textsc{PathTools} tracing framework to generate an execution trace.
First, the user selects a test case of interest that should be traced and visualized.
For instance, this selection can be done through the list of test coverage information that is displayed next to methods in the source browser provided by the \textsc{PathTools} framework.
A \inlinecode{Tracer} object is generated which subsequently initiates the instrumentation phase.
Each method covered by the selected test case is replaced by a \inlinecode{MethodWrapper} that contains the fundamental tracing functionalities.
Thereby, only those methods are regarded that lie within the user-defined tracing scope, i.e. are a member of one of the packages the user selected for tracing.

Method wrappers \cite{brant_wrappers_1998} offer a convenient way to intercept the execution of specific methods.
As the name suggests, they wrap instances of \inlinecode{CompiledMethod} and take their place in the method dictionary of the corresponding class.
They can be utilized to execute code before and after the invocation of the wrapped method.
Furthermore, they allow the inspection and manipulation of arguments as well as of the return value of a message send.
Thereby, the operation of method wrappers is fully transparent for the callers of wrapped methods.

Afterwards, the tracer executes the specified test case.
Since all methods of interest are instrumented at this stage, they automatically report their execution to the tracer.
As method entry and exit events are recorded, a call tree of the selected test case can be constructed.

Once the execution of the test case finishes, the tracer triggers the de-instrumentation phase.
The previously created method wrappers are removed from the method dictionaries and the wrapped compiled methods are put back into their original places.

Finally, the collected information can be converted to a \textsc{PathObjects} trace, which resembles a sequential representation of the execution rather than a tree structure.

\subsubsection{Refinement Runs}
Conceptually, refinement runs are very similar to the shallow analysis process.
The differences are that no test case has to be selected, since the tracer already has a reference to the covered test case.
Furthermore, only those methods are instrumented that are actually required to collect the data that should be refined.
For instance, if the developer queries the state of an argument for a specific message send, only this method is instrumented.
Afterwards, the test is executed again and the installed method wrapper verifies if the current message send is the one the developer specified.
If this is the case, the state of this argument is recorded and reported to the tracer.
Once the test is finished, all method wrappers are removed, and the trace visualization can be updated with the refined information.

The fundamental prerequisite of this strategy is that test cases are strictly deterministic (cf. Section \ref{ss:DiscussionLimitationsTestQuality}).
Otherwise, the returned information might not be related to the developer's query.
For instance, the state of a different object might be returned when a method is called with different arguments in repeated executions.
Additionally, non-deterministic branching that yields a diverging call tree could have the consequence that the refinement run never reaches the specified point of the execution.

\subsubsection{Extensions}
In order to be suitable for the purposes of \textsc{PathObjects}, the tracing framework had to be extended in two places.
First, a custom \inlinecode{MethodWrapper} had to be implemented that collects the information required for the reconstruction of object interactions.
For each wrapped executed method, this specialized wrapper reports integer identifiers of the receiving object, of the method arguments, and of the return value to the tracer.
Thereby, argument objects are flattened.
That means that if collections of objects are used as arguments, the identifiers of the objects contained in a collection are reported in addition to the identifier of the collection object itself.
Note that an identifier for the sender of a message is not captured, since it would require the expensive operation of stack inspection.
However, this information can be easily reconstructed from the tree structure of the traces, since the sender of a message is identical to the parent element of a call node in the call tree.

The second extension that had to be made is the implementation of a custom \inlinecode{Tracer} that provides some functionality required by our method wrappers and for additional refinement runs.
It provides an implementation of our object identification approach (cf. Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingIdentification}) that is used by the method wrappers to generate unique and stable identifiers for objects that occur during tracing.
Furthermore, it provides entry points for the exploration of outbound object references, and is responsible for the execution of refinement runs that are necessary to collect this information (cf. Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingReferences}).

\subsection{Reference Tracing}
\label{ss:ImplementationTracingReferences}
Outbound object pointers - or in other words the set of objects a specific object references - can be determined with the help of  \inlinecode{Object>>outboundPointers}.
However, this method returns only the set of directly referenced objects.
For example, if an instance of \inlinecode{Subject} administers a collection of observers, it would return only the collection object itself, but not the observer objects contained in this collection.
Undoubtedly, this is the technically correct behavior.
But for our purposes it seems more suitable to return those indirectly referenced objects along with the actual references. 
More often than not, this is the actually relevant information for a developer.
Therefore, we decided to flatten the objects returned by \inlinecode{outboundPointers}, and generate identifiers as depicted in Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingIdentification} for the resulting objects.
Thus, objects that are wrapped in collections are included when a developer queries the outbound references of a specific object.

Unfortunately, the collection of object references is an expensive operation in two respects.
First, a call of \inlinecode{outboundPointers} is time consuming and thus could slow down the tracing process significantly.
Second, the amount of collected data could grow rapidly if all outbound pointers of all involved objects were collected up-front.
For these reasons, we decided to implement the tracking of object references with the help of refinement runs.
As soon as the user selects an object for reference tracing, the outbound pointers of this object are collected whenever the user steps to another part of of the execution history.
The respective referenced objects are highlighted with a user-defined background color.

As pointed out in Section \ref{ss:ImplementationTracingIdentification}, objects will always be associated with the same identifier in repeated test executions.
This fact is exploited to map the references that are returned from refinement runs to the objects of the current trace.
However, to guarantee that the identifiers from the refinement runs correspond to the identifiers from the shallow analysis run, both executions have to be identical in terms of the tracing code that is executed.
Hence, it is not sufficient to instrument only the method that represents the current step of the execution history.
It is important that the method wrappers request identifiers from the tracer in the exact same order and quantity as in the shallow analysis run.
For instance, if an object identifier would not be requested, all subsequent assigned identifiers would differ from the ones assigned during the first tracing run.
Therefore, the refinement runs for object reference tracing mostly correspond to a shallow analysis run.

\section[Object Placement and Edge Routing]{Object Placement and Edge Routing%
\sectionmark{Graph Drawing}}
\sectionmark{Graph Drawing}
\label{s:ImplementationLayouting}

This Section describes how \textsc{PathObjects} traces can be mapped to directed multigraphs and describes how we used the state of the art in graph drawing to place objects and messages in our interactive diagrams.
Furthermore, the interoperability of \textsc{Graphviz} and the Squeak environment is depicted.

\subsection{Preliminary Considerations}
The structure of a \textsc{PathObjects} trace can be interpreted as directed multigraph $G$, meaning that the edges constitute a multiset rather than a set (cf. Definition \ref{eq:ImplementationGraph}).

\begin{equation}
G = (V, E)
\label{eq:ImplementationGraph}
\end{equation}

Objects are the set of vertices $V$ in this graph.
Message sends between two objects form the multiset of ordered pairs $E$, with each element having the form $(S,R)$.
Thereby, $S$ denotes the sender of a message, and $R$ its receiver.
Contrarily to the traditional definition of simple directed graphs \cite{berge_graphs_1985}, loops have to be allowed, since message exchange between objects is bidirectional more than often.

The multiset $M \subseteq E$ of messages that are exchanged between two specific objects $n_1$ and $n_2$ can be expressed with the help of formula \ref{eq:ImplementationGraphMessages}.

\begin{equation}
M(n_1, n_2) = \left\{ (s,r) \in E \phantom{i}| \phantom{i} (n_1 = s \land n_2 = r) \lor (n_1 = r \land n_2 = s) \right\}
\label{eq:ImplementationGraphMessages}
\end{equation}

Consequently, this allows to express the number of messages $C_M$ that are exchanged between two objects as cardinality of $M$ (cf. Formula \ref{eq:ImplementationGraphMessageCardinality}).

\begin{equation}
C_M(n_1, n_2) = \left\vert \phantom{i} M(n_1, n_2) \phantom{i} \right\vert
\label{eq:ImplementationGraphMessageCardinality}
\end{equation}

The transformation of a \textsc{PathObjects} trace to a graph structure is straightforward.
All occurring objects are mapped one-to-one to vertices of the graph.
However, not all messages have to be represented by corresponding edges due to the fact that only a predefined number of messages $M_{max}$ are maximally shown in a diagram at the same time.
For instance, if $M_{max}$ is set to $4$, the graph that is presented to the user can never show more than $4$ edges between two objects at once, even if $5$ or more messages are exchanged between them.
Consequently, the number of edges $C_E$ that are required between two specific vertices is the minimum of the predefined maximum value $M_{max}$ and the number of messages that are actually exchanged between them.

\begin{equation}
C_E(n_1, n_2) = min(C_M(n_1, n_2),\phantom{i} M_{max})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Graphviz Integration}

The graph drawing process consists of three phases.
First, a so-called dot-file is generated that contains a description of the graph in the format \textsc{Graphviz} expects.
Second, \textsc{Graphviz} is executed and the generated file is used as input parameter.
The result of this execution is a file that contains the coordinates of nodes as well as the coordinates of all edge bends.
Third, this file is parsed, the coordinates are translated to the Squeak coordinate system, and the morphs of the visualization are placed accordingly.

For each object that occurs in a trace, a node definition is added to the \textsc{Graphviz} graph definition.
For each pair of objects $(n_1, n_2)$, $C_E(n_1, n_2)$ edge definitions are added to the definition.

\begin{graphviz}[caption={Exemplary definition of a \textsc{Graphviz} graph, consisting of two nodes and three directed edges.}, label=lst:ImplementationGraphDot]
digraph Observers {
	graph [rankdir=LR, splines=ortho]
	node [shape=none, fixedsize=true]
	edge [arrowhead=none];
	
	1002 [width=1.54, height=0.38, label="a ClockTimer"];
	1027 [width=1.61, height=0.38, label="a AnalogClock"];
	...
	1002 -> 1002;
	1002 -> 1027;
	1002 -> 1027;
	...
}
\end{graphviz}

An example dot-file that results from the generation phase is given in Listing \ref{lst:ImplementationGraphDot}.
Line one starts with a definition of a directed graph.
Edge routing is configured to be orthogonal, and nodes and edges are configured to fit exactly to the extent definitions that are given later.
Lines six and seven show two exemplary definitions of nodes.
They start with an identifier, which conforms to the identifiers that are used during tracing, and is followed by a specification of the extents.
The labels are for illustration purposes only and are not required for the graph drawing functionality in our use case.
Lines $9-11$ show three definitions of edges, whereby one is a self loop and the other two illustrate that graphs are multigraphs.

Once the dot-file is written, a native installation of \textsc{Graphviz} is invoked through the Squeak Foreign Function Interface with the following command line:
\begin{center}
\inlinecode{dot graph.dot -s100 -y -Tplain-ext -o layout.dot}
\end{center}
The \inlinecode{-s100} argument instructs \textsc{Graphviz} to use a scale of 100 dots per inch.
This is necessary since \textsc{Graphviz} uses inches as internal measurement unit, and all coordinates and extent attributes have to be converted from points to inches and vice versa.
Using a multiple of 10 ensures that no rounding errors occur on that account.
The \inlinecode{-y} flag causes an inversion of the vertical axis, and thus the usage of a coordinate system with top-left origin.
Since Squeak uses such a coordinate system, this obviates the need to manually perform this conversion later.
Finally, \textsc{Graphviz} is instructed to use the \inlinecode{plain-ext} format for the results, and to write the calculated layout to a new file called \inlinecode{layout.dot}.

As soon as the \textsc{Graphviz} process exits, the resulting layout can be parsed from the generated file.
An example of this \inlinecode{plain-ext} format is given in Listing \ref{lst:ImplementationGraphDot}.
Each line represents either a graph definition, a node definition, an edge definition, or the stop identifier which marks the end of the file.
Analogous to the input values, the measurement unit for widths, heights, and coordinates is inches.
To convert those values to pixel values, they have to be multiplied with the resolution argument passed to the \inlinecode{dot} executable.

\begin{graphviz}[caption={Output in plain-ext format as produced by \textsc{Graphviz} for the input from Listing \ref{lst:ImplementationGraphDot}}, label=lst:ImplementationGraphPlainExt]
graph 1 14.306 4.5451
node 1002 9.9444 3.1528 1.5417 0.375 "a ClockTimer" ...
node 1027 13.042 2.0139 1.6111 0.375 "a SDigitalClock" ...
...
edge 1002 1002 16 9.1735 3.255 8.6827 3.255 8.1389 3.255 ...
edge 1002 1027 7 9.8472 2.9659 9.8472 2.6371 9.8472 1.9896 ...
edge 1002 1027 7 10.719 3.2316 11.558 3.2316 12.778 3.2316 ...
...
stop
\end{graphviz}

The graph definition consists of the scaling factor, the width of the graph (1430px), and its height (454px).
The node definition contains the identifier of the node, the coordinates of its center, its extent, and its label.
The styling attributes like border- and background-colors were omitted from the output since they are not relevant for our use case.
An edge definition starts with the identifiers of the two nodes connected through this edge.
It is followed by the number of control points defining the B-spline forming the edge, which conform to edge bends in the case of orthogonal edge routing.
For instance, the edge in line 5 has 16 bends, and their x and y coordinates are subsequently enumerated in pairs.
Again, styling information like edge style and color have been omitted.

Once parsing is completed, the obtained layout can be used to adjust the extent of the \textsc{PatchObjects} canvas, and to place the objects on this canvas.
To route the edges for a specific step of the execution history, messages $m_i$ between two objects $n_1$ and $n_2$ are mapped to their representative $E_i$ from the multiset of edge definitions according to their relative position in the message sequence (cf. Definition \ref{eq:ImplementationGraphMapping}).
\begin{equation}
E_i(n_1, n_2, m_i) = m_i \bmod C_E(n_1, n_2)
\label{eq:ImplementationGraphMapping}
\end{equation}
This ensures that one message will always be mapped to the same edge when a user navigates to a specific point of the execution history repeatedly.
Furthermore, as pointed out above, it is guaranteed that enough edge definitions exists to depict any given point of the execution history.
