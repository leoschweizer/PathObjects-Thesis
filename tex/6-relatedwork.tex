Syst√§ et al. present a reverse engineering environment called \textsc{Shimba} \cite{systa2001shimba}, which supports both static and dynamic analysis of Java software systems.
Static information about software entities - like classes, interfaces and their relationships - is extracted from the bytecode representation and visualized using \textsc{Rigi} \citep{Muller:1993:USS:962289.962309} in the form of directed dependency graphs.
Runtime traces are collected with the help of a customized SDK debugger and can be synthesized as UML-like sequence and statechart diagrams through \textsc{SCED} \citep{Koskimies:1998:ASM:624623.625817,891472}.
